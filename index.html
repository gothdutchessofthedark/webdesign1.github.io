<h2 style= "text-align:center">By Thomas Hardy</h2>
<p style= "text-align:center">"The house is bleak and cold<br/>
Built so new for me! All the winds upon the wold<br/>
Search it through for me;<br/>
No screening trees abount,<br/>
Keep on view for me"</p>

<p style= "text-align:center"> "My Love, I am planting trees <br/>
As a screen for you, <br/>
Both form winds, and eyes that tease, <br/>
And peer in for you. <br/>
Only wait till they have grown, <br/>
As I mean for you." </p>

<p style= "text-align:center"> "Then I will bear it, Love, <br/>
And will wait," she said. <br/>
- So, with years, there grew a grove. <br/>
"Skill how great!" she said. <br/>
"As you wished, Dear?" - "Yes, I see! <br/>
But - I'm dying; and for me 'Tis too late," she said. </p>
